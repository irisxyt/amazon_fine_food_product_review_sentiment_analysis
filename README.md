** - Sentiment Analysis: 
VADER Lexicon: VADER clearly shows the polarity and intensity (‘compound’ score), which enable us to determine the weights of positive, negative and neutral  opinions . Then we cab test the accuracy with ‘score’ as actual polarity. If the accuracy is not satisfied, we can fine-tune by adjusting the threshold parameter.
 - Topic Modeling 
  - LDA Function: By displaying the top N words, comparing the coherence, perplexity and log likelihood scores, we can adjust the number of topics.
